# Contributing

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and 
effective for everyone involved!

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Pull Request Process
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).

1. Follow the PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md filling all the required fields detailing your contribution
   and motivation.
2. Ensure all necessary tests have been run and that the stylecode of the project is followed. Also,
   if you have included any new 3rd party libraries update the `setup.py` file. Don't forget to install
   the pre-commit hooks `pre-commit install`.
3. Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new 
   parameters, new functionalities, etc. Also remember to include your name as a contributor.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of with at least one other developer,
   or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

### For new Contributors

If you never created a pull request before, welcome :tada: :smile:!

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ahmedkhalf/Circle-Evolution
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name> develop
   ```

4. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in
   the `README.md` file.

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
